            <p> We at Kazembe Coffee and Cafe would like to extend our warmest regards for visiting our site.
                We are a family owned restaurant established in 2018 by our late loving father whose vision was to serve people 
                from around our community with the best food and drinks and ensure customer satisfaction is guaranteed.</p>

            <p> We want to serve as a center of social interaction and provide our patrons with a place to congregate, talk
                read, write, entertain one another or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups. For those sitting in, we 
                provide them with free internet to browse and catch up on their social media handles while enjoying our delicious food.
                We also created a play park for your adorable kids to play in and not disturb you so everyone is invited
                For individuals who are in a hurry to travel abroad or going to work, we have a drive-thru where you can get served on-the-go and not worry about long standing queues. </p>

            <p> We are open everyday from 7:30am-5:30pm Mon-Fri and 8:00am-6:00pm Sat-Sun. We dont take bookings but we have tables available inside and outside for walk-ins.
                We are located at number 23 Jefferson Street Cnr 4a-5a Perrins Court Harare.
                Feel free to get in touch with us over the phone: +263771666946 or on our email address: www.kazembecafe41@gmail.com</p>
